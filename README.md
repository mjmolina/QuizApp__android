# Scientific Quiz App

Scientific Quiz App for Udacity Android basics Challenge 

Here is my third project of this introductory course from Google, a Scientific Quiz App!.

As a scientist, I have been always looking for new ways to share scientific knwoledge.
Most of the people are always curious about things, but maybe they are afraid of asking questions, they believe, are too simple.
With this App I think it will be a nice opportunity to answer those questions, in a fun way.

The App is designed to be suitable for people of all ages, because I tried to keep the content of the questions, as simple as possible,
and there is no much technical words.

## Specifications

* It's a scientific quiz App with 15 questions in total (currently),
* Every game has only 5 questions that are selected randomly, from the total (15),
* Every question, belongs to a certain scientific category, currently Biology, Chemistry and Physics,
* I personally designed every element of the App, which follows a Pastel color pallete.
* The App respond well when switching between Landscape and Vertical views.
* When the user decide to check the answers, an text will appear under each question with the explanation of the answer.
* At the end of the Quiz there are two buttons to: Check the answers and to play again.
